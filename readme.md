Macro Recorder Features:
- Smart Recording - combines hold and release actions into press or click whenever appropriate. Simultaneous multiple key presses and releases are combined into a single hold, release or press action.
- High Accuracy - the Macro Recorder accurately records mouse movements when Record Mouse Movements option is selected. Mouse clicks are always recorded with cursor coordinates, so selecting this option is not recommended for recording simple mouse actions.
Mouse click time and keys press time are recorded with high accuracy.
- Editable Macros - recorded macros can be added to a custom voice command and edited later. Other types of actions can be added to it. You can also share your macros with friends by using Export Profiles feature.
